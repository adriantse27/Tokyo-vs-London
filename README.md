This is a Udacity Project and the main objective is to choose a data set to analyze using  the CRISP-DM methodology.

In this analysis, I will be using Python along with numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and various packages to complete.

The CRISP-DM will be on the medium and python booklet.

Because the data files are too huge at over 100 mb, so there is no way to incorporate the files into Github. 

I saved a HTML file for my python jupyter notebook along with its original notebook, but the HTML will have all the outputs included.

Not included in the repository: 
Tokyo and London Data Sets

The above files were all retrieved from [InsideAirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
